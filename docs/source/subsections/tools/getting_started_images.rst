1 Giotto and Image Data
=======================

Multiple images may be attached to the Giotto object. Spatial data can
be overlaid upon these images which may then be used for downstream
analyses. While Giotto attempts to automate the addition and alignment
of images as much as possible, manual adjustments may sometimes be
necessary. This tutorial will be covering both automatic and manual
adjustment.

The examples in this tutorial will be worked using Visium’s normal human
prostate FFPE
`dataset <https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/normal-human-prostate-ffpe-1-standard-1-3-0>`__
for both the Visium (automatic) and manual adjustment workflows. A manual download of this data is required; please see **Visium Directory Structure Details** below.

For an example of working with high definition images that may require
ROI alignment and or stitching, please see the Nanostring CosMx lung
data
`analysis <../datasets/Nanostring_Lung12_jan26_21.html>`__.

2 Conceptual Overview
=====================

Giotto currently supports two types of image objects. For most purposes,
images are loaded in using `terra <https://rdrr.io/cran/terra/>`__ and
are then placed into **giottoLargeImage** objects. **giottoLargeImage**
objects only load in sampled subsets of the original image that are
needed to represent the image, increasing efficiency for analysis of
very high-resolution images.

Alternatively, smaller images are loaded in using the
`magick <https://rdrr.io/cran/magick/>`__ package and are then placed
into **giottoImage** objects. This offers direct access to the powerful
image processing functionality in the *magick* package among other
Giotto functions for analysis and viewing. **giottoLargeImage** objects
can be downsampled into **giottoImage** objects when necessary through
use of the **convertGiottoLargeImageToMG()** function.

**giottoImages** are S4 class objects with slots containing the image
itself and the metadata necessary to plot it properly. The **magick**
package allows easy access to image processing functions as well as the
ability to access images through pointers, so the images are only loaded
into memory when needed.

Please note that as a result of using pointers to access the image,
**giottoImages** will not be saved between sessions, since the pointer
will die after a given R session is closed. However, the information
used to create the image will be retained within the **giottoObject** in
the **images** slot, as described below.

| When incorporated into a **giottoObject**, **giottoImages** are added
  into the **images** slot of the **giottoObject**. The **images** slot
  is organized as a **list()** so multiple **giottoImages** may be added
  and then referred to individually using the **name** which they have
  been given.
|  **giottoImage Structure**
| - name - *name of the giottoImage, does not need to match the name of
  the variable which stores the giotto image. Default is ‘image’.* -
  mg_object - *image loaded in as magick object (pointer)*
| - minmax - *x and y minimum and maximum values found from spatial
  locations\**
| - boundaries - *adjustment values for stretching the image based on
  minmax values*
| - scale_factor - *scale factor of spatial locations to image*
| - resolution - *spatial location units covered per pixel*
| - OS_platform - *computer environment*

\*Note that **minmax** refers to the relevant values of the associated
spatial locations rather than those of the image. These values are given
either by providing spatial locations directly when calling
**createGiottoImage()** or in later steps that involve a
**giottoObjects** with associated spatial locations.

|  For maximum flexibility, Giotto plots images and spatial data on
  different layers that are largely independent of each other. The
  spatial data is plotted first, essentially serving as an anchor
  **(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)**. The image, no matter its actual
  dimensions or resolution, is then **stretched** to fit on the plot
  according to accompanying metadata **(xmin_adj, xmax_adj, ymin_adj,
  ymax_adj)** which can be edited by the user.
|  |image1|
| Calling the **giottoImage** by itself will display its class and name,
  followed the values that occupy its minmax, boundary adjustment,
  scale_factor, and resolution slots. The actual image boundaries are
  displayed as spatial values, which detail the points to which the
  image’s edges will be stretched.

| Most spatial datasets currently generate spatial locations based on
  how they map onto an original image. Although this brief explanation
  is somewhat simplified, Giotto’s automatic alignment works as follows:
| - Scale image dimensions to original dimensions by dividing by the
  **scaling_factor**
| - **xmin_adj** = (spatial location xmin) - 0
| - **xmax_adj** = (xmax image bound in original dimensions) - (spatial
  location xmax)
| - **ymin_adj** = (spatial location ymin) - (ymin image bound in
  original dimensions)
| - **ymax_adj** = 0 - (spatial location ymax)

For instance, assume a **giottoImage** object named GImage has already
been created:

Standard workflow.

3 Visium Workflow (Automated):
==============================

Assembly of Giotto object as well as the reading in and alignment of the
tissue staining image from the Visium spatial subdirectory is done
automatically using **createGiottoVisiumObject()**.

Note that in order to run the following code, the Output Files “Feature
/ barcode matrix (raw)” and “Spatial imaging data” from the
`dataset <https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/normal-human-prostate-ffpe-1-standard-1-3-0>`__
must be downloaded and extracted into a structured Visium directory.

Here, details on how to structure the Visium Directory for creating a
Giotto object using **createGiottoVisiumObject()** for the purposes of
this tutorial will be shown. Nonetheless, this procedure is standard
practice for using Giotto with Visium Data.

First create a new directory. This will be the Visium Directory. Then,
open a terminal within that directory, and enter the following commands:

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: bash

        wget https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/spatial-exp/1.3.0/Visium_FFPE_Human_Normal_Prostate/Visium_FFPE_Human_Normal_Prostate_raw_feature_bc_matrix.tar.gz
        tar -xzvf Visium_FFPE_Human_Normal_Prostate_raw_feature_bc_matrix.tar.gz
        wget https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/spatial-exp/1.3.0/Visium_FFPE_Human_Normal_Prostate/Visium_FFPE_Human_Normal_Prostate_spatial.tar.gz
        tar -xzvf Visium_FFPE_Human_Normal_Prostate_spatial.tar.gz

This will create two subdirectories within the Visium Directory, titled
“raw_feature_bc_matrix” and “spatial”. These subdirectories will contain
barcode and expression information, or images and scaling information,
respectively. Now, the Visium Directory may be inputted to
**createGiottoVisiumObject()**!

.. raw:: html

   </details>

A giotto object using either the hires or lowres image will be loaded
depending on whether “\ **tissue_hires_image.png”** or
**“tissue_lowres_image.png”** is provided to the **png_name** argument.
In this example, the hires image will be plotted.

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: r

      library(Giotto)
      library(GiottoData)

      VisiumDir = '/path/to/visium/directory/'
      results_directory = paste0(getwd(),'/gobject_imaging_results/')

      # Optional: Specify a path to a Python executable within a conda or miniconda 
      # environment. If set to NULL (default), the Python executable within the previously
      # installed Giotto environment will be used.
      my_python_path = NULL # alternatively, "/local/python/path/python" if desired.

      # Optional: Set Giotto instructions
      instrs = createGiottoInstructions(save_plot = TRUE, 
                                        show_plot = TRUE,
                                        save_dir = results_directory, 
                                        python_path = my_python_path)

      # Create a Giotto Object using Visium Data
      FFPE_prostate <- createGiottoVisiumObject(expr_data = 'raw',
                                                visium_dir = VisiumDir,
                                                png_name = "tissue_hires_image.png",
                                                instructions = instrs)

      # visualize spots that are in tissue
      spatPlot2D(FFPE_prostate, 
                 show_image = TRUE,
                 cell_color = 'in_tissue',
                 save_param = list(save_name = 'high_res_IT'))

4 Standard Workflow
===================

4.1 Step 1: Invert Y-Values
---------------------------

Before beginning, it is important to acknowledge that differences may
exist in the conventions for defining coordinates within images and
plots. As a result, it is often required to make the spatial location y
values negative. This inversion is necessary for the spatial locations
to appear in the same orientation as the image. This transformation of
the spatial locations is automatically done for Visium datasets during
**createGiottoVisiumObject()**. In the standard workflow, it is
important to determine if this is necessary for the data at hand.

.. raw:: html

   <details>

   <summary>

**Why this inversion is necessary**

.. raw:: html

   </summary>

.. raw:: html

   <hr>

| **Image Coordinates vs Plotting Coordinates**
| By convention, the origin of image coordinates is defined in the upper
  left, and coordinates increase rightward (x coordinate) and downward
  (y coordinate). Many spatial methods inherit this convention when
  generating spatial location data. However, Giotto plots with the
  coordinates originating from the lower left. Thus, without inversion
  of the y coordinates, the **spatial locations are displayed as
  vertically flipped compared to how they are intended to be seen**.
  |image3|
| **The fix for this is to multiply all the Y-values in spatial
  locations by -1, inverting them.** This may be done prior to creation
  of the giotto object by multiplying the y values within the spatial
  location matrix by -1. If the giotto object has already been created,
  yet the spatial data still needs inversion, running the following
  commands will invert the y coordinates.

Here, my_gobject refers to the **giottoObject** and my_spatlocs refers
to the name of the **spatial locations** to which the image will be
aligned.

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: r

      # Retreive original spatial location data
      spatlocs <- get_spatial_locations(gobject = my_gobject,
                                        spat_loc_name = my_spatlocs)

      spatlocs$sdimy <- -spatlocs$sdimy # Note the negative sign operator for inversion

      # Overwrite the original spatial locations with the inverted ones
      my_gobject <- set_spatial_locations(gobject = my_gobject,
                                          spat_loc_name = my_spatlocs,
                                          spatlocs = spatlocs)

   </details>

4.2 Step 2: Create giottoImage
------------------------------

| giottoImages are created using the **createGiottoImage()** function.
  This function requires a **magick**-compatible image (eg. jpg, tiff,
  png) to be provided to the **mg_object** argument as either a filepath
  or a **magick** object.
| If automatic image alignment is desired, the **scale_factor**
  parameter is required, which scales the spatial locations to the
  image. *This parameter is required since spatial locations do not
  contain information about the size of the image is past the spatial
  xmax and ymin values. Those two image bounds are instead inferred by
  scaling up the current image dimensions to those of the spatial
  locations.*

For Visium datasets, scaling information is available in the
**scalefactors_json.json** file found within the **spatial**
subdirectory.

**scalefactors_json.json** for this
`dataset <https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/normal-human-prostate-ffpe-1-standard-1-3-0>`__:

.. container:: cell

Providing the appropriate factor to the **scale_factor** parameter will
result in automatic alignment.

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: r

      lowResPath <- paste0(VisiumDir,"Spatial/tissue_lowres_image.png")
      lowResG_img <- createGiottoImage(gobject = FFPE_prostate,

4.3 Step 3: Add giottoImage to giottoObject and Visualize
---------------------------------------------------------

**addGiottoImage()** adds a **list** of images to the **giottoObject**
specified. The name that the image is referred to as within the
**images** slot is inherited from the **name** argument during
**createGiottoImage()**. The default name is “image.”

5 Manual Adjustment
===================

| Manually adjusting the plotting of images comes either during
  **createGiottoImage()** using **do_manual_adj = TRUE** and the four
  adjustment values **(xmin_adj, xmax_adj, ymin_adj, ymax_adj)** or
  after **giottoImage** creation using **updateGiottoImage()**.
| This method is performed by eye and may be necessary depending on
  preference or if despite accounting for scaling, the image coordinates
  do not match up with the spatial coordinates for some reason.
